## 2.0.0

*Release Date: 2024-12-19*

- Non-backward compatible changes:
    - Re-named several Hexital arguments
        - candles_lifespan -> candle_life
        - candlestick_type -> candlestick
    - Re-named several Indicator arguments
        - input_value -> source
        - fullname_override -> name
        - candles_lifespan -> candle_life
        - candlestick_type -> candlestick
        - rounding_value -> rounding
    - Candle's now require a timestamp, a single candle added will use the current UTC time
    - Candle timeframe attribute:
        - Candle's now have a timeframe attribute, this shows the resolution of the Candle, this is optional for Candle's
        - Merging Candle's now take into account first and last Candles for accurate Open/Close value updates
        - Appending Candles will now be sorted, allowing to say Append missing or back data
        - Improved the speed of Candle timeframe collapsing

- Re-wrote Testing method
    - Removed unreliable deepdiff rounding
    - Removed soft Correlation Coefficient
    - Custom accuracy none rounding driven custom diff check
- Updated Movement methods to accept `Indicator | Hexital | List[Candle]` and searches the given
  object to find the specific'd indicator(s)
    - Movement methods can now accept Indicator's from different timeframes when used with Hexital object
- Added 'candles_average' method to Indicator
- Added 'exists' to do same as prev_exists for correct handling dict's

- Updated Hexital append with optional 'timeframe' to select specific Candle's to append too
- Updated 'candles' in Hexital method to accept timeframe's or indicators
