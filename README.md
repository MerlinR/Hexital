## `Early Development`‚ùó
Note: Extremely early stages and likely change drastically, including core functionality and methods.
## Hexital
`Hexital` is a Python library implementing financial indicators for technical analysis. The distinctive feature of the library is its incremental computation of indicators which is designed to fit real-time applications or applications with iterative input in general.

For most libraries such as [Pandas-TA](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta) which is fantastic for generating Indicators for a large set of data, it's incredibly slow when computing real-time/incremental data sets. The entire input vector is always used to calculate new values of indicators, which is a major cause of this speed issue. Despite the fact that these indicator values will remain unchanged and/or you don't want past data points to be changed by new data. `Hexital` resolves this by using an incremental approach, only calculating new/missing indicator value's, this implies it requires O(1) time to produce new indicator values in comparison to O(n) (or worse) required by other libraries.


### Indicators
- ATR
- EMA
- MACDR
- RMA
- RSI
- SMA
- TR

### Analysis
Simple useful Candle Anaylsis methods such as those in `Pine Scripting`
- Positive/Negative Candle
- Rising/Falling Indicator
- Mean Based Rising/Falling Indicator
- Highest/Lowest Indicator (Value)
- HighestBar/LowestBar Indicator (Offset how far back)
- Indicator Cross
- Indicator CrossOver/CrossUnder
- 
### Installation
```bash
pip install hexital
```
In case you want to install the latest development version from the repo, use
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/merlinr/hexital.git@development
```

## Upcoming Features

Roughly ordered in priority

- More Indicators
- More Analysis methods
- Pattern Candle recognition methods, detecting Doji, Hammer, etc
- Pattern Indicators, use above methods to run automatically as indicators
- Support for automatic multi timeframe indicator generation
  - E.G: With 1 minute candles, we can generate EMA for minute candles and 5 minute candles
- Indicator Pluggability, to allow easy extension of this library
  - Allowing custom Indictors to be added
- Multiprocessing, of indictors stored within hexial Class.
  - Likely wont see increase in performance

## Testing
Testing is a huge part of this library as it's incredibly difficult to ensure the accuracy of the indicator values being generated. In order to solve this this I rely on [Pandas-TA](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta) as my source of truth for the indicator values. Each indicator added to this library requires a test that uses the Pandas-TA lib indicator output as the expected result.

## Inspiration
This library was was inspired by [TALIpp](https://github.com/nardew/talipp) which is another Incremental Technical Analysis Library, however I disliked the seperate input lists rather then an entire candle, and futhermore outputs are seperated entities requiring lots of managing.
